# Pika.py
🤖 A Discord Bot for the power-user in all of us!

# Features
* An awesome Moderation system, including an unique voting system for nickname changes, kicks, bans, and mutes!
* Many fun commands!
* It's a Pikachu, come on! You got to love it!

# How to Run It
Oh, you want to run it? Sweet!
Make sure you got the discord.py rewrite installed, and these packages aswell:
```
dataset
pyshorteners
pokebase
```
After that, make sure you edit the **bot owner ID** and the **bot token** in ``bot.py``.
Then run ``bot.py``, and you're off!
